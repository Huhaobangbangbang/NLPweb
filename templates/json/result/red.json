      "This Cat Tree Is Dangerous     I wouldn’t buy this again, and I’m kicking myself for not returning it when I had the chance. The list of reasons is long.First, I just want to say that I hate that this product page is for every tree made by this company because it makes it really difficult to find reviews for the product you’re looking at. I’m including pictures so you can see which one I have. It’s got two “stories,” a small box, a large box, and a ball activity box on top of one of the 3 pillars on top.When I received the tree, the pieces that are supposed to come assembled weren’t assembled properly. The supports that go inside the boxes to hold the roofs up weren’t attached at all, so I had to install them myself.There are pieces on this tree that could be dangerous for your cat. For example, inside the ball activity box, there’s a brass piece that you screw the post into, but it doesn’t lay flush with the bottom of the activity box, and there are holes your cat can get its claws stuck in. This is particularly dangerous because the whole point of the activity box is for your cat to fish inside with its paws. I covered the piece with hot glue and so far haven’t had a problem, but I’ve read reviews on here from other cat guardians who had to hurt their cat to get their cat’s claws free.The rope is held on the scratching post with industrial staples which is really dangerous.As far as size goes, this tree is really designed for kittens (I’ll never understand why cat trees are designed for less than 6 months of a cat’s life). My girl cat is chunky, but she’s a relatively small cat, and she doesn’t fit in the small box. She also almost got herself stuck in the hole in the roof of the larger box.It’s extremely top heavy and entirely too narrow to support itself, which results in way too much wobbling for my larger cat to be comfortable playing on it. He climbs it occasionally, but just sits on top, which is heartbreaking to watch because until he got scared by the wobble, he loved the toys on the pillars.The ladder is flush with the edge of the bottom box, which makes climbing down really difficult because there’s no lip for cats to rest their paws on. And since the top of that box has a hole in it, there’s nowhere beside the ladder for them to step.When you put the tree together as directed, there is only 1 post with sisal rope at ground level, so if your cats don’t like scratching that fleece-like material (mine don’t), they’re going to wear it out pretty quickly. And there are no posts short enough to go under the bottom box that have sisal rope on them, so even then, there will only be 2 sisal posts at ground level. Which wouldn’t be as much of a problem if it wasn’t so wobbly, but since it is, my cats aren’t comfortable scratching the higher posts.The sisal rope is garbage. We received this tree on December 7, and the cats had already ripped through the sisal rope by February.All in all, this tree is dangerous, bad quality, and definitely not meant for large cats. Don’t buy it.": {

      "DANGER! Poisonous! Don't buy!     BEWARE - This cat tree almost killed me, my family, and my cats. Possibly formaldehyde or a strong chemical glue created a toxic gas in my home. Aside from a funny smell, I didn't notice it at first as I was putting it together. Then my lips started to swell up, itch, burn, and sting. My eyes got puffy, red, itchy, and sore. I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. The room started to appear to spin. I had to put the cat tree outside and ventilate my house and it took forever to be able to breathe properly. I lied down with a splitting headache while hallucinating for hours. It was extremely painful and horrifying. Even after we aired it out outside for a couple of days, it was still extremely toxic. I couldn't get near it even when it was outside on my balcony in the open air. No one in my family could go near it without getting extremely sick. We had to hire someone to rebox it so we could return it. I will never buy from Go Pet Club again. I suspect some of the five star reviews are either fake or the humans using this thing are rarely at home or never get near it. It is not safe! It has scared me off of buying cat furniture online. I'll probably save up the $200 or so needed to get a decently safe, if slightly more boring looking, cat tree from a local pet store so I can at least be sure it isn't deadly poisonous. Beware of this one! I'm sorry to leave such a scathing review, but this was beyond horrible and I lost money shipping it back because I couldn't even touch it. I couldn't eat because my lips were like crazy stinging balloons. Please buy something else. Be safe.": {

      "Our cats LOVE this tower, but the quality just isn't there     Ordered this tower on January 26, 2019; it was delivered two days later. It took my 13 yo son and me about 20 minutes to put together. The photos and print in the instructions are tiny, making it a bit of a challenge to read. But it is pretty simple to figure out what part goes where.The cats absolutely love this tower - jumping from level to level, climbing the jute post, swatting the attached toys, lazing on the perches.Two stars because the fabric is extremely thin and is already starting to tear after 2 1/2 months of light use. Additionally, the tower wobbles pretty dramatically when they jump from the floor onto one of the platforms. It hasn't tipped over yet, and because the base is so large, it doesn't seem likely to.Overall a disappointing purchase because of the quality of the fabric covering. I intend to file a claim under the AmazonBasics warranty re: the tearing fabric. Hopefully they will replace the platform with the tears. I will update my review after I get a response to my warranty claim.": {

The oddest part of the design is that the second level platform is the same width and length as the first, so the cats cannot jump from the first to second platform directly. The hammock and fabric nest are pretty small. Fine for the kittens, but the adult does not use those at all, and if she did, I don't think the fabric nest could support her weight.

      "Don't expect this to be usable by a normal cat     I purchased this unit to put in my bedroom to give my cat a place to climb up to be able to see out of the second floor bedroom window. It was annoying to put all the pieces together but I just got a cup of coffee and took my time. I was very disappointed in the quality. I wish I would have returned it immediately. I decided to keep it and planned on recovering it with real carpeting since the material covering the unit was cheap, thin felt- like fabric that is glued on. It pills up, is very easily shredded by cat claws, and was a constant mess for a few feet around the base of the cat tree. I had to vacuum daily and there was raw wood showing within the first week just from ripping as my cat climbed up to the upper levels.The components are extremely low quality. The screws wouldn't go in correctly and worse, wouldn't stay in. I was constantly finding screws that had worked their way loose and would fall to the carpet below. I have a small puppy and worried that he would pick up a screw and swallow it. I had to check the floor before I could let the puppy in the bedroom and was always pulling the fluff bits that had shredded off out of his mouth between daily vacuumings. The puppy is a very small breed and the torn off felt material was another choking hazard.Before I even got the free time to recover the unit in carpet, it began to fall apart. The posts that hold the too-small platforms were very wobbly and within the first month, the plastic component at the join of the square house and the post broke when my cat was climbing it, sending both the post and cat to the floor. This is a small-frame 10 pound cat.The cat tree went to the trash because the components were not even sturdy enough to spend the time reinforcing and covering with decent carpeting. I strongly advise you not to waste your money. It's a matter of getting what you pay for. I didn't want to spend $200 on a cat tree, but now I will be spending that plus the $100+ that I wasted buying this inferior cat tree. Just save yourself the money and irritation and go buy a good quality cat tree..": {

      "Small platforms, but lots of scratching post and lots of platforms     This product is reasonably price for what you get. I have built one cat platform with scratching post using 4x4 and the cost of the rope alone was nearly $20 and it only was 30\" tall. Plus rug adhesive, the hassle of building it.I like the design, minor quibble is that our main cat that uses it is not the biggest cat I've seen but he's big and 14 lbs, and he does not fit the platforms at the top well. He hangs off every side. 12x14\" is not big enough for USA cats, although he manages. The tubes are plastic/cardboard mix, but seem to work ok. The boards are all flake board as expected, a bit thin at roughly 1/2\" or maybe 5/8\". The base is too thin, and the towers wiggle a bit causing my cat to look somewhat nervous when going up/down. I will likely cut a 3/4\" plywood base and glue to the bottom for added stability.That said, I could not have justified spending a whole day making one of these from my scraps in my shop when I can get it all nicely finished for about $100 from Amazon delivered. Sure beats the prices at the pet store. I will likely cut some plywood and make a bigger platform for the top one and cover with something similar, but my wife thinks I'm crazy.Positives:* Lots of places for your cats to sit. Mine spent the first three days camped out in the house, now he sleeps on the top platform (even though he's hanging off edges!)* Assembles easily* Comes with tool for assembly* lots of scratching places. My fat cat likes the lower ones, where she can lay and scratch, the big male the higher ones.* hanging toys are entertaining.Negatives:* Small size design - the platforms, house, everything is more for smaller framed cats. Dont get this if you have huge cats they wont like it much.* A bit thin on the fuzzy covering but OK* could be sturdier* could be made from thicker wood* does not have any \"feet\" for bottom* my cat at first preferred the box it came in* now one of the cats does not sleep with my daughter anymore, he sleeps on the cat tree!

The scratching posts would be better if covered the entire length with the clawing rope. My guess is the platforms on which the top posts sit, which hold the weight of the cats and resting perches, will sag over time because the particle board isn't too thick.

The item weighs more than the estimated 52 pounds (converted from the 24 KG) and it says on the outside of the box 54 pounds. They also have directions for lifting of two people, so you know this weighs more than described. My grown husband and son both carried this box up the stairs. My main issue is with the delivery. The PO would not deliver it and Amazon called on my behalf to have them schedule two deliveries. The reason for making this purchase online and with Amazon is to have it delivered.Once I personally went to pick it up, with help of a neighbor to drive us there, the unpacking started. The god awful smell will linger in your house for hours. You might want to open the box and let it air out on the porch. The directions were easy to follow. Assembly happened in a short 10 minutes on my own. The stability is terrible and construction of this items is awful. I have 2 other cat towers that are far better than this one and sure wished I didn't look at the reviews that were positive.You can note the photos, the rope is not like my other cat trees. I don't believe this is sisal rope and when I assembled, the rope actually cut my fingers when I was twisting it together. There is so many sharp ends sticking out, more like a plastic twine rope. There is also an end that is attached by a staple, so a few scratches and you can already see where this is going to go. The posts also are wrapped with the material, and as you can see, the ends are going to be pulled up easily.As for your cats, it is very small. In the photo you will see my gray cat that is rather large, about 12 pounds, he can not fit into the top box. The larger box is at the bottom and we all know as cat owners, they like to be up high. Why this was designed with a super small box at the top is something I can't understand. The photo of the platforms at the top. My black and white cat is 5 years old, he is rather small and about 5 pounds. This skinny guy is taking up most the room, so my other cats will be cramped for space when they want to sleep on these.Overall, the problem you will also face will be just like mine. The shipping is not going to come to your door and you will be required to pick it up yourself. Might as well go to the pet store. I want you to know, this is the 3rd tree I have purchased on Amazon and the others arrived by UPS. You will also see this tree is super small with all the areas. The spacing between everything is smaller when you compare it to other brands.I have spoken with Amazon Customer Service through my entire experience and they are well aware that it didn't arrive to my home.

The top part isn't too stable, and I have a rather small male cat. after jumping off it and onto it over a few months, it started loosening up. Believe it or not, the cats managed to break the plastic cap which has the threading for the bolt onto of it. Rammed a few drywall screws through it to hold it together for a while. Back in October it finally broke for good. I find the cubby for them to be too small for most cats. I had a very small female runt which can sit in it, but that's the extent of it's use. The swinging part below, forget it. All three cats hated it. The ladder I found to be useless as well. They'll jump up onto it. They'll never walk up the ladder. Avoid this feature, it's a waste in my opinion. Overall, it's a bit shakey, so I'd keep it in the corner of the house. The walls seemed to keep it upright. Never fell over.Now for the pros. This thing, collects cat hair like no other. I have three long hair cats, and most of their hair ends up on this, not around the house. They love sitting on it in the window (it's now in two pieces to sit in the window area in the living room). The basket my runt cat loves and tends to hide in it well. The posts my cats gravitate to. I have cedar board walls in two spots in the house, and not a single scratch, thanks to this. The rope they do play with or bite on as well, and when there are a few on it they do tend to play quite a bit on it batting each other. Another pro, is that you can mix parts around when something does break. Like I stated before, the top broke, but I was able to move around a few pieces and reconfigure it to keep using it. I've owned it for 2 years now, it's still being used. Would I recommend it? Probably not unfortunately because, most people have probably larger cats than mine. two of them are 9lbs, one is 6lbs. It's too small for the 9lbers to use some parts of it. I'd recommend probably getting some tools and material and building your own out of wood. Even if it isn't covered in carpet or a fleece material, my cats like the natural wood on my home made cat scratch and even lay on the base of it. If you do decide to still get one of these, I'd suggest liquid nailing the posts in place and using some lock tight on the bolts to keep it together. However, I feel that since it's made out of cardboard tubes and plastic in some spots, it'll still break eventually.": {

They completed ripped through the front of the house fabric, and also started to do so on the sides. I’ve only had this tree for a couple of weeks and it’s already torn up on the house section. Not to mention cats like to eat strings...and this fabric when ripped up is nothing but strings. My cat was choking yesterday and though she finally stopped and seemed fine after a few seconds, I noticed the strings hanging off the cat tree and can only hope that she’s not literally eating the fabric. Which, wouldn’t surprise me if she was. I can’t be the only one who has had this problem. I’m really shocked that the houses aren’t durable and stabilized by hardwood. Or least made with something not so easily destroyed and potentially dangerous to cats. I’m disappointed in this product, it doesn’t say anywhere in discriptions that the tree is made this way.

To say the assembly directions were shallow in depth might be the understatement of the year. Also, there's a design flaw in the tree. More specifically, there's very little way for larger or older cats to get from the second to the third level, since the left-most facing corner of the third floor completely blocks climbing access between levels. A 45-degree cut along that edge would likely solve that problem. Also, the screw hooks for the hanging hammock below the second floor are both too thin and too long. They barely thread into their mounting holes; and, if fully tightened, pointedly protrude through the carpeting--constituting an injury hazard for cats.

My larger cat is only about 9-10 pounds and she won't go near it on her own. I got them both to go up it by putting their food bowls up there, but after they were done eating, both of them went right back to their place on the window sill.So, basically I bought a $100 staircase for the cats to get up to the windowsill.

      "Best for Young or Smaller Cats     My kitten is already about 8+ pounds at 7 months old and still growing. That being said, I expect he'll outgrow this cat condo by the time he's a year old. The tube at the top is very short and small. While he doesn't look cramped now in the sheltered cylinder on the second level, I expect he will be by the time he's fully grown. Also, be careful of the hardware that holds up the hammock. There's nothing that stops the hooks from going straight through the second level shelf and I caught my hand on them a few times while putting it together.As for the structure as a whole, it's fairly solid. My kitten treated the house like a parkour course before I bought this product and even with him launching off myself and other furniture onto the condo, it hardly even wobbles. The only part that is iffy is the 4th tier where the tube hangs. I tightened it until it didn't turn anymore when I built it and over the course of three days I've been able (and needed) to tighten it twice more.The last thing is something that took me by surprise. Usually, as well as the sisal rope, cat trees are made with rough carpeting. This tree isn't covered in carpet, but rather a soft, furry type cloth. The kind like plush toys are made of. It comes out easy, so expect a fuzzy mess to sweep up after building it and for that to continue if your kitty claws any part besides the sisal rope.It was very easy to build. The diagram is easy to follow and there's an included hex key.EDIT (2/28/15): At roughly the two week mark, the 4th tier loose part (mentioned earlier) broke entirely. I hadn't tightened it any more after the review was written, but I noticed it getting more and more wobbly. I decided to take that part off to see what was going on. The tubes themselves are hollow cardboard with a black plastic cap. Inserted within the cap is a nut that is what grips the threads and holds the tube to the provided screws.The reason that tier was wobbling was because the black plastic, through normal cat use, broke. The nut stayed on the screw so that the whole piece was able to just be lifted off; no unscrewing required.This just reinforces that if you have a cat who is REALLY active or heavier (I'd say more than 5 pounds), then find another cat tree.": {

I usually buy Armarkat towers (I’ve had 4 total) but liked the way this one looked, it also had all good reviews so I confidently gave it a shot. That was a mistake! Thankfully Amazon refunded me since I was within the refund time frame. I’m now gonna take that refund and buy an Armarkat tower! Those hold up! At one point I had 7 cats in my home, have fostered and rehomed 19 kittens and never once did a hole rip through an Armarkat tower! I think there’s a design flaw with Feandrea towers... they have the “carpeting” on the posts near where the cats are suppose to scratch and claw! Armarkat towers just have the rope material on the posts and the fabric/“carpeting” where the cats lay.": {

My cat was able to easily scratch off the carpet too, after having it up for not even 5 seconds I watched her get stuck and rip it off. For the amount I spent I would of thought it be better quality.
