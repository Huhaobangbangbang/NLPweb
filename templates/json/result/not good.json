      "lets start with the bad. The top part isn't too stable     Well, you get what you pay for. There are some pros and cons, lets start with the bad. The top part isn't too stable, and I have a rather small male cat. after jumping off it and onto it over a few months, it started loosening up. Believe it or not, the cats managed to break the plastic cap which has the threading for the bolt onto of it. Rammed a few drywall screws through it to hold it together for a while. Back in October it finally broke for good. I find the cubby for them to be too small for most cats. I had a very small female runt which can sit in it, but that's the extent of it's use. The swinging part below, forget it. All three cats hated it. The ladder I found to be useless as well. They'll jump up onto it. They'll never walk up the ladder. Avoid this feature, it's a waste in my opinion. Overall, it's a bit shakey, so I'd keep it in the corner of the house. The walls seemed to keep it upright. Never fell over.Now for the pros. This thing, collects cat hair like no other. I have three long hair cats, and most of their hair ends up on this, not around the house. They love sitting on it in the window (it's now in two pieces to sit in the window area in the living room). The basket my runt cat loves and tends to hide in it well. The posts my cats gravitate to. I have cedar board walls in two spots in the house, and not a single scratch, thanks to this. The rope they do play with or bite on as well, and when there are a few on it they do tend to play quite a bit on it batting each other. Another pro, is that you can mix parts around when something does break. Like I stated before, the top broke, but I was able to move around a few pieces and reconfigure it to keep using it. I've owned it for 2 years now, it's still being used. Would I recommend it? Probably not unfortunately because, most people have probably larger cats than mine. two of them are 9lbs, one is 6lbs. It's too small for the 9lbers to use some parts of it. I'd recommend probably getting some tools and material and building your own out of wood. Even if it isn't covered in carpet or a fleece material, my cats like the natural wood on my home made cat scratch and even lay on the base of it. If you do decide to still get one of these, I'd suggest liquid nailing the posts in place and using some lock tight on the bolts to keep it together. However, I feel that since it's made out of cardboard tubes and plastic in some spots, it'll still break eventually.": {
