The Amazon rep had me package up the broken part and send back for a replacement. Then a whole new tree arrived, and guess what?!? The same part was broken in the replacement! So then I shipped that back and got my money back. Even if the parts had not been broken, we could tell by having it even half-way together that it would be very wobbly and unsafe for our cats.

                        "This Cat Tree Is Dangerous     I wouldn’t buy this again, and I’m kicking myself for not returning it when I had the chance. The list of reasons is long.First, I just want to say that I hate that this product page is for every tree made by this company because it makes it really difficult to find reviews for the product you’re looking at. I’m including pictures so you can see which one I have. It’s got two “stories,” a small box, a large box, and a ball activity box on top of one of the 3 pillars on top.When I received the tree, the pieces that are supposed to come assembled weren’t assembled properly. The supports that go inside the boxes to hold the roofs up weren’t attached at all, so I had to install them myself.There are pieces on this tree that could be dangerous for your cat. For example, inside the ball activity box, there’s a brass piece that you screw the post into, but it doesn’t lay flush with the bottom of the activity box, and there are holes your cat can get its claws stuck in. This is particularly dangerous because the whole point of the activity box is for your cat to fish inside with its paws. I covered the piece with hot glue and so far haven’t had a problem, but I’ve read reviews on here from other cat guardians who had to hurt their cat to get their cat’s claws free.The rope is held on the scratching post with industrial staples which is really dangerous.As far as size goes, this tree is really designed for kittens (I’ll never understand why cat trees are designed for less than 6 months of a cat’s life). My girl cat is chunky, but she’s a relatively small cat, and she doesn’t fit in the small box. She also almost got herself stuck in the hole in the roof of the larger box.It’s extremely top heavy and entirely too narrow to support itself, which results in way too much wobbling for my larger cat to be comfortable playing on it. He climbs it occasionally, but just sits on top, which is heartbreaking to watch because until he got scared by the wobble, he loved the toys on the pillars.The ladder is flush with the edge of the bottom box, which makes climbing down really difficult because there’s no lip for cats to rest their paws on. And since the top of that box has a hole in it, there’s nowhere beside the ladder for them to step.When you put the tree together as directed, there is only 1 post with sisal rope at ground level, so if your cats don’t like scratching that fleece-like material (mine don’t), they’re going to wear it out pretty quickly. And there are no posts short enough to go under the bottom box that have sisal rope on them, so even then, there will only be 2 sisal posts at ground level. Which wouldn’t be as much of a problem if it wasn’t so wobbly, but since it is, my cats aren’t comfortable scratching the higher posts.The sisal rope is garbage. We received this tree on December 7, and the cats had already ripped through the sisal rope by February.All in all, this tree is dangerous, bad quality, and definitely not meant for large cats. Don’t buy it. 置信度：0.9987032413482666",
